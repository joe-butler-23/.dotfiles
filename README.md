# Joe Butler's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for various tools and applications I use on my Linux system.

## Hardware Setup

### Keyboard

I use a Corne (crkbd) split ergonomic keyboard with a custom keymap. The Corne is a 3x6 column-staggered split keyboard with 3 thumb keys on each half. For detailed information about my keyboard setup, see the [keyboard README](/config/keyboard/README.md).
